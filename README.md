# Analog Clock
Analog clock developed with HTML5, CSS3, Sass & JavaScript

SASS-based Analog Clock is a stylish and visually appealing application that showcases the capabilities of SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The main function of this clock is to display the current time in an analog format, mimicking the design of traditional clocks.

The design of the clock is built using SASS, which allows for more efficient and modular CSS code development. SASS allows the use of variables, mixins and nested rules, making it easier to create and maintain complex styles in a more organized way.

HTML5 provides structure for the clock with elements representing hour, minute and second hands. These elements are styled using CSS3 to create the desired visual effect, including smooth animation for the movement of the hour and minute hands.

JavaScript is used to get the current time from the device's internal clock and update the rotation of the hands accordingly. The JavaScript code determines the rotation angle for each hand based on the current time, ensuring accurate representation on the clock face.

This SASS-based Analog Clock demonstrates the power and versatility of CSS preprocessors like SASS combined with the capabilities of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It offers a visually appealing and interactive way to display the current time in a classic analog format.
